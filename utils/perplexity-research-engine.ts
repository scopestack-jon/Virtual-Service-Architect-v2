Provide a comprehensive research response in this EXACT JSON format:
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "title": "exact title from source",
      "url": "full URL",
      "summary": "detailed summary of what this source covers relevant to the implementation",
      "credibility": "high|medium|low",
      "relevance": 0.85,
      "sourceType": "documentation|guide|case_study|vendor|community|blog|news|other"
    }
  ],
  "researchSummary": "comprehensive analysis of the technology implementation including scope, requirements, challenges, and best practices based on all sources",
  "keyInsights": [
    "specific technical requirement or consideration",
    "implementation challenge or best practice",
    "cost or timeline consideration",
    "compliance or security consideration"
  ],
  "confidence": 0.85
}

Requirements:
1. Find 5-10 high-quality, recent sources
2. Prioritize official documentation, vendor guides, and authoritative technical resources
3. Include implementation-specific details (sizing, architecture, integration)
4. Focus on practical guidance for professional services scoping
5. Ensure all URLs are real and accessible
6. Provide relevance scores (0.0-1.0) based on implementation specificity
7. Include diverse source types for comprehensive coverage

CRITICAL: Return ONLY the JSON response. No explanations, no markdown, no additional text.

Focus on current, authoritative sources that collectively provide comprehensive coverage. Prioritize quality over quantity.`
